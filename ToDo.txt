new stuff:
- physics
    - collision checks
        - bounding box for objects (probably not 1-to-1 with the mesh for easier computing)
    - collision handling
        - seperate functions for each set of two objects
- add tests for more functions
- add multiple color meshes
    - let each tri be a different color
    - let tris be drawn as a png
- add functionailty to pick an object by looking at it and tranform that specific object
    - ray cast to find an object
        - probably just check each object rather than actually stepping along a ray since theres few objects in the scene

fixes:

optimizations:
- make drawTri (and other draw functions) skip out of range values entirely rather than letting writePixel do that work
- add a draw queue which will have one (or maybe more) threads to work only on drawing, while the main thread can do the math and feed the stuff that needs to be drawn to the queue
