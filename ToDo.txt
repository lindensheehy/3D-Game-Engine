new stuff:
- physics
    - collision checks
        - bounding box for objects (probably not 1-to-1 with the mesh for easier computing)
    - collision handling
        - seperate functions for each set of two objects
- add tests for more functions
- add multiple color meshes
    - let each tri be a different color
    - let tris be drawn as a png
- add a crosshair
- add functionailty to pick an object by looking at it and tranform that specific object
    - ray cast to find an object
        - probably just check each object rather than actually stepping along a ray since theres few objects in the scene
    - have a way to mark an object as chosen such that controls can tranform it
        - probably the simplest way is to store an Object* which contains one from the set

fixes:

optimizations:
- make drawTri (and other draw functions) skip out of range values entirely rather than letting writePixel do that work
