new stuff:
- physics (the big one)
    - collision checks
        - bounding box for objects (probably not 1-to-1 with the mesh for easier computing)
    - collision handling
        - 
- add tests for more functions
- add multiple color meshes
    - let each tri be a different color
    - let tris be drawn as a png

fixes:

optimizations:
- make drawTri (and other draw functions) skip out of range values entirely rather than letting writePixel do that work
