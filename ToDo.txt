new stuff:
- add tests for some important functions, or all if im feeling ambitious
- add Font class to draw text to the window
- add colors to meshes
- implement a lighting vec
- Object class
    - make a doFrame(dt) function
    - some basic collision like with the floor

fixes:
- something in the projection process is failing, this is likely because of misuse of radians and degrees in places.
- fix triangles not working correclty to shown when facing cam (might be because of using radians in Tri3->isFacing())
