# 3D Graphics Engine in C++

This is a 3D graphics engine written in C++, designed as a personal project to push my skills in both C++ and 3D graphics programming. The goal of this project was to learn as much as possible about C++, while also working on material I find interesting, all while keeping the dependencies to, in my opinion, the absolute minimum and building most of the core functionality from scratch. I chose to limit my use of dependencies so much because I find a lot of value in understanding how things work behind the scenes, for example, instead of using `<math.h>`, I did the necessary research to implement the needed functions myself.

## Key Features:

### Rendering
- **Depth Buffering:** Implements a basic depth buffer to ensure that objects are rendered correctly with respect to their depth in the scene.
- **Transparency Handling:** Support for objects with varying levels of opacity, with a basic algorithm to blend transparent objects over the background and other objects.
- **Projection & Camera System:** Uses perspective projection to simulate a 3D camera in a 2D space. The camera system can be easily extended to support multiple cameras in the future.

### Custom UI
- **Custom UI Elements:** Supports a range of UI components, including buttons, textboxes, dividers, etc., with the ability to dynamically handle inputs and render windows on the screen.
- **UI Hierarchy System:** The UI elements are organized hierarchically, with a parent-child relationship, making it easy to manage complex window layouts.

### Physics (Work in Progress)
- **Physics Framework Setup:** Infrastructure for handling simple physics concepts like acceleration, velocity, and position. The physics system is ready to implement features like object collisions and more detailed interactions.

## Technical Details:

- **Custom Math Library:** This project uses a custom math library for all necessary mathematical operations (e.g., `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.). Key functions like square roots and trigonometry are implemented from scratch using techniques like the Newton-Raphson method and Taylor series approximations.
- **Custom Data Structures:** To manage 3D data and ensure the performance of the engine, I built custom data structures like vectors (`Vec2`, `Vec3`), triangles (`Tri2`, `Tri3`), and meshes (`Mesh`). These allow efficient manipulation of vertices, normals, and other properties needed for 3D rendering.

## Libraries & Dependencies:
- **SDL2:** Used for window creation, handling input, and managing the pixel buffer to draw directly onto the screen.
- **Standard C++ Libraries:** A minimal set of standard C++ libraries. Functionally, the only required library is  `chrono` for delta time, but I also use `iostream`/`fstream`/`iomanip` for debugging and logging.
- **Custom Libraries:** This project heavily relies on custom-built libraries for anything I felt was feasible for me to implement. 

## Controls:
- **W, A, S, D:** Move the camera in the 3D space
- **Space:** Ascend
- **Ctrl:** Descend
- **Shift:** Sprint (increases movement speed in all directions)
- **Left Click + Mouse Movement:** Look around (rotate the camera)
- **Q, E:** Select objects and cycle through them (will also create a 'Transform' window)
- **J, K, L:** Rotate the selected object
- **U, I:** Translate the selected object along the X-axis
- **T, Y:** Translate the selected object along the Z-axis
- **O, P:** Translate the selected object along the Y-axis
- **G:** Toggle gravity on or off (only affects objects, not the camera)
- **Z:** Make all the objects 'jump' (just gives some vertical veloctiy)
- **N:** Show normals on all rendered triangles. These will appear as small red lines

## To Do:
- **Collision Detection:** The main goal for the next iteration is to implement object collision detection, which is crucial for a more realistic physics system.
- **Physics Enhancements:** Adding more physics features like rigid body dynamics, forces, and complex object interactions.
- **UI Enhancements:** Improve and expand the UI system for more advanced interactions, including dynamic window resizing and draggable elements.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `BuildAll+Run.bat` (Windows) to compile and run the project

## Conclusion
This is very much a passion project for me. As much as it is a learning opportunity to develop my skills, it's also driven by my interest in 3D graphics and my love for building things from scratch. I could talk for hours about any individual part of this project, because a lot of time and thought went into everything.
