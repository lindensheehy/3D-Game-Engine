The files included here are needed for compilation.
These files are for 64 bit systems, because thats what I have.
If you do not have a 64 bit system, you will need to download the SDL2 files manually.
In that case you should either change the bat files to point to the right location at the top under "SDLinclude" or simply put them in the folder here.
