/*
    This file doesn’t do anything yet, but it’s here on purpose.
    I set this up early while planning out the engine structure.

    It’s meant to hold the code for a custom build system, designed to replace the current batch files.
    The system will use file timestamps to dynamically compile only changed files.

    This part has been postponed until V2, as I don't think the implementation is fit for this version

    Leaving it here to show what was planned. Not forgotten, just moved forward.
