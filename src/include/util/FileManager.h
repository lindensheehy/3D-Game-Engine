/*
    --- THIS FILE IS NOT PART OF THE CURRENT BUILD ---

    This file is incomplete, but itâ€™s here on purpose.

    The class is intended to store references to all currently loaded file data
    So any file data should only be managed through this class (once its implemented)

    This code only exists to help layout the project structure.
    It will be properly implemented (or refactored) in V2.

    Leaving it here to show what was planned. Not forgotten, just moved forward.
