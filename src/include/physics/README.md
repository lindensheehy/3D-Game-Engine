# `src/include/physics/`

This directory contains all code related to object-level handling, including object data structures and basic physics. The physics implementation is currently minimal and still under development.

---

## Contents

- `Bounding.h` — Defines physics bounding boxes. Currently unused and incomplete.
- `ObjectSet.h` — Contains the `Object` and `ObjectSet` classes. `ObjectSet` is the primary data structure intended for managing game objects.

## Dependencies

This section lists high-level **per-module relationships**.  
A module being listed here does *not* imply that **all files** in that module are involved —  
only that **one or more files** are directly included.

- `geometry/`
- `graphics/rendering/`
- `util/`

#### For more details, please refer directly to the code. The code is extensively commented, so most questions will likely be answered there.
