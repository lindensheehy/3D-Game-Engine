/*
    This file doesn’t do anything yet, but it’s here on purpose.
    I set this up early while planning out the engine structure.

    It’s meant to hold the code that builds the runtime data structure to hold fonts. 
    This will either parse a readable file, or directly load a binary if it exists.

    Leaving it here to show what was planned. Not forgotten, just deferred.
