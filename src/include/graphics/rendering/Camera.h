            The frustum is symetric, so the 'Top' and 'Left' values are equivalent to 'Bottom' and 'Right' respectively
            These values are in relation to the width and height of the frustum at the near plane
            As they are scaled with depth, these effectively make up the width/height ratio of the frustum at any depth
