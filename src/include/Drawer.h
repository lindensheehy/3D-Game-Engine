        This class acts as a function set to draw to a gui window.
        A pixel buffer is the only SDL2 functionality I allowed myself to do, so this class implements all the drawing functions I need.
        The pixel buffer is simply a single dimension array, and the buffer width represents the length of each 'set' within the array.
        Treating the pixel buffer as a 2d array acts as follows:
        buffer[2][3] = buffer[(2 * bufferHeight) + 3], where 2,3 is x,y
        This class supports the use of depth. When including depth values into function calls, the depthBuffer will be checked before writing pixels
        Depth is optional, and any call where depth is not included will be drawn at depth 0, while NOT updating the depthBuffer values
