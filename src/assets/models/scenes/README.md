# `src/assets/models/scenes/`

This directory is intended to store per-scene data files for the engine.

Right now, it’s basically empty and unused by the current build — or really, by anything yet. It mainly exists to show what was planned for future development.

This will definitely grow in the next version, as it’s a critical part of the engine’s infrastructure. It’s in this state because I was just starting to plan it when I decided to shift development focus to a new version.
