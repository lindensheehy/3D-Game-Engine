This file stores the character textures used for my font renderer
Each character is stored in order in this file. This file is then parsed into a more usable format.
Youll notice these textures are huge, this is because my renderer downsizes the textures to produce textures

Each character has its label at the top, denoted by the character in square brackets
Then following each character label is a 32x32 grid of pixel states

The characters used are:
'â–ˆ' -> this represents a true value. These pixels will be 'on'
' ' -> this represents a false value. These pixels will be 'off'

There are also '|' delimiters to help keep track of the characters

My code starts interpreting this file after the start tag (in square brackets)
