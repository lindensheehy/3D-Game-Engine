# `src/assets/textures/`

This directory is intended to hold texture files used by the engine.

Right now, it’s just an empty placeholder. Image decoding and texture loading are planned for the next version.

This directory is absolutely necessary, but the project just hasn’t reached the point where it’s used yet. Since this project is lib-free, I would have to write my own image decoder to use textures. And since image decoding can be non-trivial, I haven’t dived into that rabbit hole yet :P
