        This code converts the range value between -180 and 180 into a value within the fov where values outside of 0-1 mean its outside the fov
        This is an extremely simplified version of the formula so it looks like nonsense but this is the math:
        First find the decimal value between -180 and 180 which represents the start of the fov
        value = (360 - k) / (2 * 360)
        Then use this value so find the new decimal for the posision
        pos = (360 * (oldpos - value)) / fov
        so this all simplifies to the math below, with a lot of type casting because I dont trust cpp auto typing
