        This class acts as a function set to draw to a gui window.
        A pixel buffer is the only SDL2 functionality I allowed myself to do, so this class implements all the drawing functions I need.
        The pixel buffer is simply a single dimension array, and the buffer width represents the length of each 'set' within the array.
        Treating the pixel buffer as a 2d array acts as follows:
        buffer[2][3] = buffer[(2 * bufferHeight) + 3], where 2,3 is x,y
