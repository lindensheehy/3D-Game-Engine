        This function is sort of complicated so heres the breakdown:

        1.  This way of calculating only works if the value of x is in (-1, 1)
            If the value is outside that range, 1/x is used instead and the angle is given as (pi/2 - found angle)

        2.  Im using power series to calculate the angle, but for performance im only using the first 5 terms.
            This series is accurate until around |x| > 0.76

            That being:

                 x^3     x^5
            x - ----- + ----- - ...
                  3       5

        3.  When the value is outside that range, I am using linear functions which closely fit the graph of arctan
            I used desmos to find these functions and fine tuned the values, so they may seem arbitrary

            Those being:

                For x < -0.76:
                    f(x) = 0.55x - 0.235

                For x > 0.76:
                    f(x) = 0.55x + 0.235


        This method gives at most a 0.5% error, with the majority of inputs giving less than 0.05% error
        This function does not need to be perfectly accurate, so I am choosing to optimize performance over accuracy
