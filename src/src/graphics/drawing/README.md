# `src/src/graphics/drawing/`

This directory handles all 2D drawing within the application. It provides a high-level `Drawer` class for general-purpose 2D rendering, as well as a lower-level `PixelDrawer` class for more explicit, pixel-level control.

---

## Contents

- `Drawer.cpp` — High-level drawing interface, offering functions like `drawRect`, `drawLine`, and more.
- `PixelDrawer.cpp` — Low-level drawing interface, primarily used through `drawPixel`.
- `PixelTracker.cpp` — Supports object selection by tracking a specific pixel. Just a glorified data container.
