# `src/src/graphics/png/`

### ðŸš§ This module is not part of the current build ðŸš§

This module is intended to handle PNG file processing. It is currently unfinished and contains only stub code from a previous implementation that relied on an external library for PNG decoding. Since this project avoids external dependencies, that decoding functionality has been removed and is yet to be reimplemented.
