# `src/src/graphics/font/`

This directory handles all font rendering for the application. It uses the `PixelDrawer` from the `drawing/` module to draw static font textures directly to the window. This implementation is minimal — it does not support anti-aliasing, font resizing, or other advanced features. It simply draws raw pixel maps to the screen.
