/*
    This file doesn’t do anything yet, but it’s here on purpose.
    I set this up early while planning out the engine structure.

    It’s meant to parse raw text data into a more usable format, 
    from where it is passed to Builder within this same directory (also unimplemented)

    This part has been postponed until V2, as I don't think the implementation is fit for this version

    Leaving it here to show what was planned. Not forgotten, just moved forward.
