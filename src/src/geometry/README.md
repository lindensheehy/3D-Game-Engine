# `src/src/geometry/`

This directory contains all core geometry-related classes used by the engine, including vectors, triangles (unused in the current build), meshes, and matrices. It also includes a subdirectory intended for importing file-based mesh data, though this functionality is not yet implemented.

---

## Contents

- `importer/` — Contains tools for importing file-based meshes.
- `Matrix.cpp` — Defines a 4x4 matrix class, primarily used for graphics transformations.
- `Mesh.cpp` — Stores 3D mesh models.
- `Tri.cpp` — Defines `Tri2` and `Tri3` classes for 2D and 3D triangles, respectively.
- `Vec.cpp` — Defines `Vec2` and `Vec3` classes for 2D and 3D vectors, respectively.
